I plan to make a shop system for my tool. The core elements that define my tool are:
-The ability to buy and sell an item
-Item price and resale price
-Item stats and name, Special Item effects, and Item Icon/Visuals
-A UI which can display these items and their prices, and can affect the item buyer's amount of money


Implementation Steps:

-Item Descriptor class - non-monobehavior: this will hold item variables such as name,stats,description, and get methods. small scale and simple for getting information and displaying it

-Inventory class: an array of items, which can get information on all the items you have and rearrange items. will also always include a "gold" variable to check if there is enough gold to purchase a specific item. add/subtract gold methods

-Inventory UI, which displays all items in inventory, including picutres, name, stats and description, cost
-Shop UI, similar to Inventory UI

Challenges: depending on what kind of item system this is, items can also have a prefab name attatched to load when utilized.
	-if the item system is like league, then only the stats and effect matter, as the items will never actually be used or consumed
	-if the item system is like Zelda BOTW, then the prefab matters to load a specific weapon or tool with unique effects and unique 		scripts attatched.

	var loadedPrefabResource = LoadPrefabFromFile("ItemName");
  	Instantiate(loadedPrefabResource, Vector3.zero, Quaternion.identity);
